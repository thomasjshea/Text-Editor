![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue?style=for-the-badge)


## Description

This application that I have build is a text editor. This is PWA app meaning that it can be installed on the user's machine and used offline. The purpose of creating the application is so that the user can easily edit text either online or offline. 


## Installation

To install this application on your machine, navigate to my [Github Repository](https://github.com/thomasjshea/Text-Editor) and clone the repository to your machine. Open the repository in your command line application and run the command npm install. This will install all dependencies needed to run the app locally. After installing dependencies, enter the command npm start and navigate to [Local Host 3000](https://localhost:3000) to start using the app. Additionally there is a banner on the webpage where you can install the application to your machine. 

## Usage

To Use this application without having to clone the repo to your machine, you can navigate to [JATE](https://guarded-cliffs-48541-489bd4b7fb1b.herokuapp.com/) and begin using the app without any installation required. From here, you are able to install the app to your computer.
